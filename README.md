This is a portfolio/blog website I built from scratch using [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction). Inspired by the template from [SvelteKit Blogger](urlhttps://sveltekit-blog-starter.vercel.app/)

## Tools

The main tools that I've used are:

- [pnpm]() as my package manager of choice
- [SvelteKit](url) as the server-side framework for Svelte
- [Tailwind CSS](url) as my preferred 'CSS framework'
- [shadcn-svelte](url) for the beautiful pre-built components
- [mdsvex]() for Markdown rendering
- [Vercel](url) as the easiest deployment option out there

## Developing

In case you might want to give it you personal spin, feel free to clone the project, install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`) and start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
